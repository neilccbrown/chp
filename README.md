Communicating Haskell Processes library
===

This is a project that came out of [my PhD work](http://twistedsquare.com/thesis.pdf).  I am not actively developing or maintaining the library but is preserved here for anyone that wants to use or tinker with it.

The original repository is lost, so this is an import of the latest version.
